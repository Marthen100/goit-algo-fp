<h2>Task 7: Using the Monte Carlo Method</h2>

The results obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations for dice rolls closely match the theoretical probabilities. This confirms the accuracy of the Monte Carlo method for estimating probabilities in random processes. The results demonstrate the reliability and usefulness of simulation techniques in probabilistic computations.
